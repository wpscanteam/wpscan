                    The default schedule is set to hourly to avoid heavy loads on the server but the frequency can be changed by using the gform_polls_cron_schedule filter.
                    The format follows the same format required by the WordPress cron_schedules filter. http://codex.wordpress.org/Function_Reference/wp_get_schedules

                    ** Important: the Polls Add-On must be deactivated and reactivated in order to reschedule the task.
            Example usage:
                add_filter( 'gform_polls_cron_schedule', 'cron_add_twice_hourly' );
                function cron_add_twice_hourly() {
                  // Adds once weekly to the existing schedules.
                  $schedule['twicehourly'] = array(
                      'interval' => 1800, // number of seconds in the interval
                      'display' => __( 'Twice Hourly' )
                  );
