If you have the reCAPTCHA or [GDPR Compliance for Mailchimp](https://wordpress.org/plugins/eu-opt-in-compliance-for-mailchimp/) plugin active, then the submit button will become full width, drop below these items, and the fields will take up 100% of the width. A similar conversion occurs when the screen size is below 768px regardless of the reCAPTCHA or [GDPR Compliance for Mailchimp](https://wordpress.org/plugins/eu-opt-in-compliance-for-mailchimp/) plugin being active.

* Updated the way we're logging errors for the homepage dashboard widgets - an error should no longer break your dashboard!
* Added some default excluded post types for our post query on the form builder (CPTS are forum, topic, and reply). This should help people who use bbPress and are experiencing timeout issues. (These can be filtered with the `yikes-mailchimp-excluded-redirect-post-types`).

* Google Analytics Event Tracking is here! We've added an action - `yikes-mailchimp-google-analytics` - where you can add Google Analytics JavaScript. Check out our knowledge base article (https://yikesplugins.com/support/knowledge-base/add-google-analytics-event-tracking/) for more instructions.

This also comes with some minor style changes and a couple new filters: `'yikes-mailchimp-{$interest_group_id}-description-html'` to filter the interest group's description HTML, and `'yikes-mailchimp-{$merge_tag}-description-html'` to filter a form/merge field's description HTML.

= 6.3.14 - April 21st, 2017 =
* Updating the WooCommerce Checkout integration checkbox with a new class and a filter for the classes (yikes-mailchimp-wooco-integration-checkbox-classes). The checkbox should now align correctly. 
* Added a new setting to the General Setting page that controls using the nonce validation. The nonce has caused numerous people issues, and the filter is difficult for some people. This new setting will turn off the nonce validation for all forms on the website. The previously added filter, yikes-mailchimp-use-nonce-verification, can still turn off nonce validation on a per-form basis.

= 6.3.13 - April 17th, 2017 = 
* Two new filters: `yikes-mailchimp-wp-comment-integration-placement` and `yikes-mailchimp-use-nonce-verification`.
* `yikes-mailchimp-use-nonce-verification` - Control whether we verify the nonce on form submissions. Default: `true` (by default, we check the nonce). @params: $use_nonce, $form_id
* `yikes-mailchimp-wp-comment-integration-placement` - Control the placement of the subscription checkbox for the WP Comment Form integration. Default: `comment_form_field_comment` (after the comment textarea box) - @params: $comment_form_field. This filter allows you to choose which WP Comment Form filter to use, and for the full list of WP Comment Form filters, check the documentation: https://codex.wordpress.org/Function_Reference/comment_form.

= 6.3.12 - April 6th, 2017 = 
* Security vulnerability patched - Discovered with DefenseCode ThunderScan Source Code Security Analyzer by Neven Biruski

= 6.3.11 - March 23rd, 2017 =
* Optimized our query that fetches all posts/pages/CPTs - we now fetch only the IDs - this should prevent issues such as memory overflow or timeout

= 6.3.10 - March 21st, 2017 =
* Added a filter to customize the options in the states' dropdown. You can now add your own states/provinces, or remove the default ones. Use `yikes-mailchimp-state-province-list`

* Adding a filter (`yikes-mailchimp-excluded-redirect-post-types`) to allow users to define which CPTs will be excluded from the list of potential redirect pages. See the "Other Notes" section for the default list of excluded post types.

= 6.3.5 - February 13th, 2017 =
* Added Canadian provinces to the state dropdown list. If you choose "Canada" as your country, you will see only the provinces. If you choose U.S. you will see only the states. For all other countries, the dropdown will fade out.

* Generated new .pot file for proper i18n/l10n

= 6.3.0 - January 17th, 2017 = 
* Version 6.3.0's biggest change is migrating the plugin to use Mailchimp's v3 API.
* Created API classes to interact with the Mailchimp API
* Converted all supported v2 endpoints to the corresponding v3 endpoint
* Refactored all v2 endpoints that are unsupported in v3 to use the new API classes

* The "Send Welcome Email" option is no longer supported by Mailchimp and has been removed
* The second address line (addr2) is never required by default (this can be changed using a filter - see `yikes-mailchimp-address-2-required`).

* Updated the storage of form data to utilize the Options API instead of a custom database table.
* Under-the-hood improvements and enhancements

As noted above, this release modifies this plugin to utilize the Options API instead of a custom database table. After upgrading, a routine will run that will grab all of your forms from the custom database table and convert them into a WordPress Option that the code will use from this point forward. At this point, we're choosing to keep the existing custom database table in place, so you can rest assured that all of your form data will be safe.

If for some reason you need to revert to using the custom database table, you can add a constant to your `wp-config.php` file:

`define( 'YIKES_EMCE_CUSTOM_DB', true );`

If you find that you *need* to do this, please contact us to let us know what you're seeing. In a future release, we will remove the custom database table entirely.
