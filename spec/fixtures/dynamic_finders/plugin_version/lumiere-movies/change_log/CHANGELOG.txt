* [major] new way to include movies inside a post, using their imdb movie's id instead of their names. Use tags [imdbltid]movie's imdb id[/imdbltid] instead of [imdblt]movie's name[/imdblt]. Idea comes from Mattias Fr&ouml;berg.
* [major] possibility to use in widget several imdb-movie-widget (or imdb-movie-widget-bymid) is back again

* [minor] turned imbd-link-transformer into a class (class imdblt{}); modified inc/popup-imdb_movie.php and inc/help.php according the new structure. As a result of this, one has to open the class (ie $imdblt = new imdblt) before calling the function itself (ie $imdblt->lumiere_external_call('Descent', 'external'))
* [minor] by default, cover pictures are not displayed as thumbnail, with a size of 100 px. To change this behaviour: "General options -> Imdb cover picture -> Display only thumbnail"

* [medium] modified imdb.css (improvement made by Jeremie Boniface, I'm not able to manage these things)
* [minor] rating (inside a post & widget) displays now pictures instead of numbers; depending of good (or bad) feeedbacks, value $imdbwidgetratingnopics has to be implemented into plugin (to permit users to get back to old display, with the numbers) -> Jeremie Boniface demand
* [minor] more french strings corrected
* [minor] brazilian updated
* [minor] only 1 user comment could be retrieved! changed plugin options according to this limitation (removed $imdbwidgetcommentsnumber)
* [minor] renamed "cache.php" to "inc/options-cache.php"
* [minor] removed robots.txt, since v. 1.1.15 workaround is efficient

v1.1.15
* [bug] (somewhat): if highslide popup is active, search engine bots will index several hundred thousands of movies and actors, since they can now follow an href. Except if you do not care at all about space and bandwith, it could down your website quickly. Moved links to highslide popups from href="" to src: '' (inside javascript) and closed the href tag. To prevent any kind of search engine crawling in a place where it should not crawl, added also a robots.txt file (not convinced about its usefulness, though), and a test at the begining of popup-header.php.
* [bug] some translated french strings were wrong
* [bug] when several directors were found, it was missing space or comma to display -> added comma
* [major] updated to imdbphp-1.1.15 library (1/hopefully fixed "invalid stream resource" on some network timeouts, movie: 2/ added method to retrieve movie types (if specified), person: 3/fixed a property missing in initialization, Fixed goofs(), trailers(), and trivia() )
* [major] every admin settings section (cache, widget & general) has its own preferences storage (new foreign keys: $imdb_admin_values, $imdb_widget_values,$imdb_cache_values, whereas $imdb_config_values is dead). As a result of this, resetting General options won't interfere with Cache options, and vice versa.
* changed the way several css directives related to popup were working (ie, all &lt;a&gt tags in owner's blog were impacted, instead of only &lt;a&gt from the popup)
* [minor] added compatibility with [link-indication plugin](http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/link-indication/ "link-indication plugin home") (modified imdb-link-transformer.php add_filter's execution priority to 11)
* [minor] mixing "imdb-movie-widget-bymid" and "imdb-movie-widget" keys actually does work! Removing references saying it doesn't.
* [minor] cache movie files into cache.php are now alphabetically ordered
* [minor] soundtrack & quotes include an internal popup link instead of a link to imdb website 
* [minor] moved imdb-widget.php to /inc/, and renamed to widget.php

* [minor] added plot limit selection (imdblt settings : Widget/Inside post Options  / What to display )
* [minor] imdb pictures displayed both in widget and inside a post can be "highslided". To achieve this, activate "Display highslide popup" option and turn "Display only thumbnail" to "no" (and put a small size value, as "150" per example).

v1.1.14.4
* [bug] in config-widget.php, a value for imdbwidgettitle (and one other) section was wrong
* [bug] a value $test (imdb-movie.inc.php) was wrongly named -> renamed to $genre

* [major] completely new cache management system; cache has its own page, and can be deleted now from this very options page (and cache for a pelicular movie can be deleted)
* [major] new kind of popup, Highslide JS. Much nicer popup, must be activated from "General options / Layout / Popup / Display highslide popup" -> change to yes to see the difference whenever you click a link opening a popup (from inside post or widget)
* [medium] added javascript to unactivate fields which shouldn't be available because of logical constraints
* [medium] added uninstall page (uninstall.php)
* [medium] added many new classes to manage in a more precise way elements in Widget/Inside post. Check imdb.css file.

* [minor] added new admin menu which can be activated via "General options / Advanced / Display plugin in big menu" -> change to yes to see the difference
* [minor] changed the way to submit preferences(config.php): now, after saving/resetting preferences, one stay on the very same page, instead going to a new (and click on "back" link). Also reset is working as it has to.
* [minor] added standard wordpress picture to plugins (top left admin settings)
* [minor] changed pages admin names -> imdblt_options now (can be seen in adress bar)
* [minor] removed old screenshots, added new ones
* [minor] consequently to many changes and functions added, plugin shouldn't work at 100% with a wordpress release prior to 2.7. However, no crucial function has been added, and even with old releases IMDb link transformer should mostly work as it used to.

v1.1.14.3
* [major] new way to include movies inside a post: use tags (new way) [imdblt]movies name[/imdblt] instead of (old way) <?php lumiere_external_call ?> + Exec-PHP plugin. That means this release doesn't need any more any kind of third party plugin! Compatibility with the old way kept.
