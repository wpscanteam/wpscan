6.0.0.0 - 2015-05-04 - Dustin Bolton
  Deployment
    New "BackupBuddy Deployment" remote destination allowing pushing or pulling your entire site to or from another existing site, in as few as two clicks.
    See differences in site server settings, active plugins, theme, versions, and media prior to deploying.
    Options to transfer the database (all tables, some, or none), plugins, theme, and/or media.

    Automatic chunking of data transferred between servers to support large files or slow servers.
    Swaps databases only after the entire database and all files have been transferred to attempt to minimize site downtime to mere seconds (or less!).
    Perfect for developing your site in a different location from the live site.  Use staging best practices.

    State data is now only output to browser javascript console when full logging mode is enabled.
    Debugging backup process data only sent to browser javascript console when in development mode.
    Fileoptions storage of the backup state now clears step arguments for finished functions to prevent buildup of state data once a function has passed (eg for deployment state or new alternate zip method state) to prevent rapid uncontrolled fileoptions file growth.

    Remote destination sends that have not been updated after a period of time are now marked as timed out and send notification email.
    Old status logs will now be removed after 10 days rather than 2 days.
    Fixed "File destination send finished email recipient(s)" feature not sending notification emails.
    Fixed issue 'Manual Backup With Send and Delete After Reports ZIP File Not Found at End' by no longer wiping send_remote_destination step information from fileoptions after function finish.
    Fixed timing issue / race condition where _getBackupStatus.php retrieving fileoptions could possibly retrieve the file mid-write, resulting in an incomplete serialized array being returned and a fatal error #9031b.

    BackupBuddy Stash Live
      Requires PHP v5.3 or newer. PHP v5.3 was released June 30th, 2009.
      The easiest to use, most shared hosting-friendly backup solution, without sacrificing any power. Live backup of all content, snapshots stored to Stash, and all files scanned for malware and viruses.
      Mirrors your complete site including files, database, and all WordPress content offsite to BackupBuddy Stash Live servers, keeping your backup in sync with your site.
      Live backup of WordPress database changes as they occur, including periodic full database dumps to insure nothing gets out of sync.
      Backup of all site files to Live servers, scanned regularly for changes, new, or deleted files.
      Schedule to regularly snapshot zip files of all the data stored on the BackupBuddy Stash Live servers.
      Option to manually create a snapshot of the stored data.
      Snapshotting results in a full backup zip file, database only backup zip file, a zip of the theme directory, and a zip of the plugin directory.
      Snapshots are fully BackupBuddy compliant zip files.
      Snapshots are fully scanned for malware and viruses, able to catch infections not normally found by front-end only scanners.
      Automatically requests BackupBuddy Stash Live servers 'ping' the site during Live activity to prevent delays between steps for low activity sites.
      Your latest snapshot zip file is stored for a week regardly of whether it is also set to save into Stash.
      Snapshots may be stored indefinitely in your Stash storage, limited only by your Stash quota.
      Advanced options to control additional inclusions or exclusions beyond your BackupBuddy defaults.
      Easy to use. Sign in with your iThemes login and BackupBuddy Stash Live immediately starts backing up your site.
      Incremental: only changed files are transferred, saving server resources and time.
      Regular file auditing. Not only are file transfers verified as they occur but also all files are regularly verified against the BackupBuddy Stash Live server to insure they are still properly in sync.
      Works on local development sites as long as either a) site activity exists (such as by you using the wp-admin) or b) you stay on the BackupBuddy Stash Live page to continue to push the cron along.
      New Sync verb backupbuddy-get-liveStats for retrieving local catalog/state statistics such as those shown on the BackupBuddy Stash Live page.
      Live update of stats when viewing the BackupBuddy Stash Live page.
  FEATURE:
    Stash (v2) destination now requests Stash Server to ping site whenever chunking commences to help push the cron along for inactive sites.
  FEATURE:
    Added single retry when attempting to schedule a one-time or recurring event in case there is a temporary problem.
  FEATURE:
    Only one BackupBuddy cron action may run per PHP page load. Subsequent actions will be rescheduled for the next load.
  FEATURE:
    If any maximum log file size is exceeded it is now trimmed down to 50% of its size (keeping most recent 50%) instead of completely deleting the log file.
  ENHANCEMENT:
    Adding remote destinations are now grouped by "Preferred", "Normal", and "Legacy" to make selecting destinstions easier.
  ENHANCEMENT:
    New option to limit the number of files returned in Amazon S3 (v2) destination. Defaults to 250 files per page.

  Remote send fileoptions cleanup now also removed lock file (if exists).
  Deployment no longer sends error emails for failed remote sends.
  Now limiting the maximum number of notifications (as used by Recent Activity page & Sync) to 25 most recent notifications to prevent excess notification buildup.
  Added new deepscandir() to replace deepglob() as deepglob() did not support directories or files beginning with a period.
  Anti directory browsing function now recursively creates directory if needed.

  S3 (v2) destination: Fixed inability to delete remote files due to extra slash in path.
  Stash (v) destination: Fixed long load times due to trying to load backup type from fileoptions. File listing no longer falls back to fileoptions for backup type.
  fileoptions no longer pauses and re-attempts to read a fileoptions file if the file does not exist; now only does this if the file exists but is empty.
  Added new {home_url} variable for error notification emails.
  Error emails now default to mentioning the {home_url} rather than {site_url} in emails.
  ImportBuddy: Now handles Live-formatting SQL filenames, prefixed with underscores. Imports underscore prefixed timestamped SQL files after normal SQL files, playing them back in the order they occurred.
  FEATURE:
    Automatic testing of the reported maximum PHP execution time.
      Improved reliability of traditional backups, remote destination sends, Deployments, and BackupBuddy Stash Live.
      Many servers report their maximum PHP execution time as a higher number than is actually available. This interferes with BackupBuddy's chunking during database backups, file transfers,
      and other operations which require a lot of time.  As of v7.0 BackupBuddy will actually test the available runtime and use the lesser value between the reported and tested numbers to
      ensure that chunking commences before time runs out, drastically reducing the chance of timeouts during any procedure where chunking is available and the server is misreporting runtime.
  Added additional logging when error is returned accessing remote API during deployment.
  Fixed AJAX URL compatibility issue with WPML plugin.
  New default log size of 3MB. Updated to new default if old value was either of the old defaults of 10mb or 5mb.
  Backup steps now schedule their single event slightly in the past to push to top. -155sec. Live schedules -60 into the past to come in second place.
  Fixed manual triggering of PHP runtime checker not showing results properly.
  Memory usage logged in Status Logs now indicates current usage rather than peak for better troubleshooting.
  Renamed "Local Directory" Remote Destination to "Local Directory Copy" to help indicate its purpose better.
  Added alert to Local Directory Copy destination informing about how BackupBuddy already stores a local copy of backups and that this is for additional copies.

  FEATURE:
    Enhanced emails added with HTML styling for better presentation of notification emails.
  FEATURE:
    Quick Setup Wizard now automatically chooses the newest version of a particular Remote Destination compatible with your server.
  Function running too long message no longer displays for zip file creation step since it tracks the time since zip file growth and warns on that.
  Now logging currentl sql file to 9010 error log file for troubleshooting.
  No longer reporting error for failed schedule creations as long as we can verify the schedule does indeed exist.
  ImportBuddy: Upgraded Stash restore functionality to use new Stash v2 API for improved performance and foreward compatibility.
  ImportBuddy: Improved Stash restore functionality interface.
  Deployment: Added new option to compare files between sites based on file hashes for enhanced reliability detecting file changes.
  Added deprecation notice to old legacy remote destination configuration to help discourage use: Dropbox (v1), Amazon S3 (v1), Stash (v1). No ETA on retirement but further notice as well as more alerts will be displayed prior to retirement.
