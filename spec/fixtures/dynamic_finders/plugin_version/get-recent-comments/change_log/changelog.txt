Changelog

Version Date       Changes
2.0.6   2009/03/31 Suppress mb_strrpos warnings, when
                   haystack is empty. Thanks to ted
                   and Michael for reporting the
                   problem.
2.0.5   2009/03/27 Make all mb_* functions optional.
                   If function does not exist - use
                   old version.
2.0.4   2009/03/27 Check for existence of
                   mb_regex_replace and if it does not
                   exist (i.e. php version < 4.2.0)
                   use old wordwrap version
2.0.3   2009/03/26 Fixed %BEG_OF_TITLE% bug. Thanks to
                   everybody who reported this problem
                   (a LOT of people)
                   Fixed broken %author_url_href
                   macro. Now it works again.
                   Fixed broken gravatar function -
                   needed to bring e-mail address to
                   lowercase before using md5 on it.
                   Applied Sven Anderson's patch which
                   replaces the most critical string
                   functions with multibyte character
                   aware php functions.
2.0.2   2007/09/25 Fix: Plugin was not compatible to
                   WordPress 2.0.11 any more. Thank
                   you to Stephan for reporting the
                   bug.
2.0.1   2007/09/24 Added switch on the categories
                   page, which reverses the selection.
                   It is now possible to include or
                   exclude categories.
2.0     2007/09/24 New code for fetching the data: 1.
                   Instead of one expensive database
                   query we now use two or more cheap
                   queries. Thanks to mirra, who
                   reported the problem. And again
                   thank you to the people mentioned
                   in changlog 1.4, where the cache
                   was introduced for the same
                   (performance-) problems on big
                   blogs. 2. This also fixed a bug,
                   which lead to too less than
                   requested comments in lists,
                   ordered by post. Thanks to Johanna
                   and Frédéric for reporting and
                   documenting this. Changed the css
                   in the admin gui, to work around a
                   display issue with Tiger Admin.
                   Thank you, Andi, for finding this.
                   Added %time_since macro, which
                   displays the time since the comment
                   was posted. Thanks to Imran and
                   Keith for sugesting (something
                   like) this (very long ago). Admin
                   interface: Added switch fpr turning
                   on and off smileys. Thank you,
                   panos, for requesting this feature.
                   Support for Custom Smileys Plugin.
                   Thanks to Henry for suggesting
                   this. Fix: Username was not
                   displayed as "Anonymous", if
                   commentor left no name. Thanks to
                   Pixelation for reporting this.
                   Added support for WordPress 2.3. It
                   will drop the post2cat table.
                   Changed plugin to new taxonomy
                   scheme. A *great* thank you goes to
                   Lakatos Zsolt, who provided a
                   complete patch for
                   get-recent-comments-1.5.6, which
                   made it very easy for me to
                   understand how 2.0-beta10 had to be
                   changed. Thank you also to xelios,
                   Ville and Kretzschmar who warned
                   me, that WordPress 2.3 will break
                   the old plugin code.
1.5.5   2007/03/26 Added support for malyfred's
                   Polyglot Plugin. Requested by
                   Torben.
1.5.4   2007/02/01 Use full pingback_author as
                   %comment_author (instead of
                   'Unknown', if the pingback parser
                   fails to recognize the
                   pingback_author. Thanks again to
                   Gant who found this in his blog.
                   Added %author_url_href macros,
                   which allows to generate inactive
                   links, if the commentator did not
                   leave an url. This was wished (in
                   part long ago) by beej, carl,
                   FilSchiesty and SwB.
                   Added %profile_picture macro, which
                   supports Hannah Gray's Profile Pics
                   Plugin. Thank you for the idea and
                   your help, Markus
1.5.3   2007/01/15 Refresh cache, when a comment is
                   approved by moderator. Problem
                   found by Gant. Thank you!
1.5.2   2007/01/05 Added option for excluding comments
                   from blog authors. Suggested by
                   This is Zimbabwe, Slim, marilyn's
                   shampoo and Igor M.
1.5.1   2006/12/29 Store the cache base64 encoded.
                   There seems to be a problem with
                   the unserialization of multibyte
                   characters. Thanks to priv, who
                   reported the problem and suggested
                   the encoding.
                   After upgrading to this version you
                   should trigger a regeneration of
                   the cache by adding a comment
                   somewhere.
1.5     2006/12/27 New pingback parser
                   Stop losing html entities and tags
                   in the post titles and comments by
                   using wptexturize. Thanks to ejm
                   (again!) and mobius for reporting
                   the problem and making suggestions.
                   Bugfix in widget code: Error, when
                   trackbacks came before comments
1.4     2006/12/24 The plugin is a widget now. Thanks
                   to herrmueller and Thomas de Klein
                   for suggesting this feature.
                   Cache the output in order to reduce
                   the database impact of the plugin.
                   Thanks to the following people for
                   reporting the poor performance and
                   making suggestions to solve the
                   problem: Brandon Stone, King of
                   Fools, Robert Basic and especially
                   CountZero.

                   (suggested by Thomas)
                   Use Wordpress 2.1 compatible

                   spencerp, for reporting and fixing.
                   Bugfix: Wrong key used in gravatar
                   hash (Thank you, Hamzeh N., for
                   finding and fixing this).

                   of wordpress 2.x.
