"\t<strong>Editing</strong> - when a <em>SWFPut</em>\n"
"\tvideo is selected two buttons should appear -- one button\n"
"\tlooks like a pencil. and this opens a graphical editor \n"
"\tdialog box, similar to the one used for <em>WordPress</em>\n"
"\tcore media editing but with some different features.\n"
"\t</p>\n"
"\t<p>\n"
"\tThis dialog provides basic setup suitable for most video.\n"
"\t<em>SWFPut</em> provides a few features not found in\n"
"\tthe setup dialog (which is meant to be simple and easy).\n"
"\tAdvanced setup is done with a form in a \"metabox\" on\n"
"\tthe editor page. You will probably not need this, but\n"
"\tif you think you might, read on. The remainder of this\n"
"\thelp section concerns the metabox advanced form, but if\n"
"\t<em>SWFPut</em> is new to you, please start with the\n"
"\tsteps described above.\n"
"\t</p>\n"
"\t<p>\n"
"\tThere is more detailed documentation as HTML\n"
"\t<a href=\"%s\" target=\"_blank\">here (in a new tab)</a>,\n"
"\tor as a PDF file\n"
"\t<a href=\"%s\" target=\"_blank\">here (in a new tab)</a>.\n"
"\t</p>\n"
"\t<h3>The Metabox Form</h3>\n"
"\t<p>\n"
"\tThere is one important restriction on the form's\n"
"\ttext entry fields. The values may not have any\n"
"\tASCII '&quot;' (double quote) characters. Hopefully\n"
"\tthat will not be a problem.\n"
"\t</p><p>\n"
"\tThe following items probably need explanation:\n"
"\t</p><p>\n"
"\t<h4>Flash or HTML5 video URLs or media library IDs</h4>\n"
"\tNear the top of the form, after the \"Caption\" field,\n"
"\ta text entry field named\n"
"\t\"Flash video URL or media library ID\" appears.\n"
"\tThis is for the video file that the flash player\n"
"\twill use. You may enter a URL by hand (which may\n"
"\tbe off-site), or make a selection from the next\n"
"\ttwo items,\n"
"\t\"Select flash video URL from uploads directory\" and\n"
"\t\"Select ID for flash video from media library.\"\n"
"\tThe first of these two holds a selection of files\n"
"\tfound under your <code>wp-content/uploads</code>\n"
"\tdirectory with a FLV or MP4 extension. Files\n"
"\tare placed under this directory when you use the\n"
"\t<em>WordPress</em> media library, but you may also\n"
"\tplace files there 'by hand' using, for example,\n"
"\tftp or ssh or any suitable utility (placing files\n"
"\tin a subdirectory is a good idea).\n"
"\tIn fact, uploading video files 'by hand' might\n"
"\tbe the easiest way to bypass size limits that\n"
"\treject large video file uploads through the\n"
"\tmedia library interface. The next field\n"
"\thas a selection of media files with a\n"
"\t<em>WordPress</em> 'attachment id' and so it\n"
"\tprovides only those files uploaded to the media\n"
"\tlibrary (with a FLV or MP4 extension).\n"
"\t</p><p>\n"
"\tAfter those three fields for flash video, there is\n"
"\t\"HTML5 video URLs or media library IDs\" which,\n"
"\tlike the flash text entry, is followed by selections\n"
"\tof files and 'attachment id's. These show files\n"
"\twith MP4 or OGG or OGV or WEBM extensions. As the\n"
"\tfield names suggest, these are for the HTML5 video\n"
"\tplayer. An important difference is that when you\n"
"\tmake a selection, the entry field is appended,\n"
"\trather than replaced, with a '|' separator.\n"
"\tThe HTML5 video entry field can take more than one\n"
"\tvalue, as explained below.\n"
"\t</p><p>\n"
"\tIt is not necessary to fill both the flash and HTML5\n"
"\tvideo URL fields, but it is a good idea to do so\n"
"\tif you can prepare the video in the needed formats.\n"
"\t</p><p>\n"
"\tBy default, HTML5 is made primary content with\n"
"\tflash as fallback. You may make flash be primary\n"
"\tand HTML5 be fallback with the \"HTML5 video primary\"\n"
"\toption on the settings page. (Go to the \"Settings\"\n"
"\tmenu and select \"SWFPut Plugin\" for the settings page.)\n"
"\t</p><p>\n"
"\tThe current state of affairs with HTML5 video will\n"
"\trequire three transcodings of the video if you\n"
"\twant broad browser support; moreover, the supported\n"
"\t\"container\" formats -- .webm, .ogg/.ogv, and .mp4 --\n"
"\tmight contain different audio and video types (\"codecs\")\n"
"\tand only some of these will be supported by various\n"
"\tbrowsers.\n"
"\tUsers not already familiar with this topic should\n"
"\tdo enough research to make the preceding statements\n"
"\tclear.\n"
"\t</p><p>\n"
"\tThe \"HTML5 video URLs\" field\n"
"\twill accept any number of URLs, which\n"
"\tmust be separated by '|'. Each URL <em>may</em>\n"
"\tbe appended with a mime-type + codecs argument,\n"
"\tseparated from the URL by '?'. Whitespace around\n"
"\tthe separators is accepted and stripped-off. Please\n"
"\tnote that the argument given should <em>not</em>\n"
"\tinclude \"type=\" or quotes: give only the\n"
"\tstatement that should appear within the quotes.\n"
"\tFor example:</p>\n"
"\t<blockquote><code>\n"
"\tvids/gato.mp4 ? video/mp4 | vids/gato.webm ? video/webm; codecs=vp8,"
"vorbis | vids/gato.ogv?video/ogg; codecs=theora,vorbis\n"
"\t</code></blockquote>\n"
"\t<p>\n"
"\tIn the example, where two codecs are specified there is\n"
"\tno space after the comma.\n"
"\tSome online examples, and even HTML specifaction pages,\n"
"\tshow a space after the comma,\n"
"\tbut browsers might reject that\n"
"\tusage, so SWFPut will normalize the codecs argument.\n"
"\t</p><p>\n"
"\t<h4>Use initial image as no-video alternate</h4>\n"
"\tThis checkbox, if enabled (it is, by default) will\n"
"\tuse the \"initial image file\" that may be specified\n"
"\tfor the video player in an 'img' element\n"
"\tthat the visitor's browser might display if video\n"
"\tis not available.\n"
"\t</p><p>\n"
"\tThere is one additional consideration for this image:\n"
"\tthe 'img' element is given the width and height\n"
"\tspecified in the form for the flash player, and the\n"
"\tvisitor's browser will scale the image in both\n"
"\tdimensions, possibly causing the image to be\n"
"\t'stretched' or 'squeezed'.\n"
"\tThe image proportions are restored with\n"
"\t<em>JavaScript</em>, but only if scripts are\n"
"\tnot disabled in the visitor's browser.\n"
"\tTherefore, it is a\n"
"\tgood idea to prepare images to have the expected\n"
"\t<em>pixel</em> aspect ratio\n"
"\t(top/bottom or left/right tranparent\n"
"\tareas might be one solution).\n"
"\t</p><p>\n"
"\t<h4>Mobile width</h4>\n"
"\tThis input field appears just below the\n"
"\tpixel dimensions fields. If this value is\n"
"\tgreater than zero, and a mobile browser is\n"
"\tdetected, then this width will be used with\n"
"\ta proportional height according to the\n"
"\tregular pixel dimensions. This might be\n"
"\tuseful when, for example, sidebar content\n"
"\tactually appears below main content due to\n"
"\tthe mobile browser's small size (theme support\n"
"\tmay be necessary to see this behavior). This\n"
"\tis probably most useful for video widgets placed\n"
"\ton a sidebar, but please experiment.\n"
"\tThe default value for this field, 0,\n"
"\tdisables this feature, and it has no effect if\n"
"\ta mobile browser is not detected.\n"
"\t</p><p>\n"
"\t<h4>Video preload</h4>\n"
"\tThis \"radio\" type option is in the <b>Behavior</b> section\n"
"\tof the form. HTML5 video allows a \"preload\" attribute\n"
"\twith a value of \"none\" or \"metadata\" or \"auto.\" This\n"
"\toption provides those three values and one special selection:\n"
"\t\"per initial image.\" This special selection will use\n"
"\t\"none\" if an \"initial image file\" is set (in the <b>Media</b>\n"
"\tsection of the form), or \"metadata\" if an initial\n"
"\timage, or <i>poster</i>, is not set.\n"
"\t</p><p>\n"
"\tThe \"metadata\" selection tells the browser that it\n"
"\tmay fetch a small part of the video file that\n"
"\tincludes information such as dimensions, duration,\n"
"\tcodec types.\n"
"\tThis can be useful because with\n"
"\tit a browser might also receive some of the video\n"
"\tframes, and so it may display one frame as a 'poster.'\n"
"\t(Whether a\n"
"\tframe displayed this way is suitable is not certain.)\n"
"\t</p><p>\n"
"\tIf \"none\" is selected the browser will not fetch\n"
"\tany of the video until it is played, and so without\n"
"\tan initial image, the video region on the page will\n"
"\tbe solid black until played.\n"
"\t</p><p>\n"
"\tThe \"auto\" selection should be avoided unless you\n"
"\tknow what it does and that you need it. This is\n"
"\tbecause with \"auto\" the browser may choose to\n"
"\tfetch the entire video even before the visitor\n"
"\tactively plays the video. Video files can be\n"
"\tquite large, and a large unsolicited download\n"
"\tmight be unkind to your site's visitors; it\n"
"\tmight even cause a visitor additional charges\n"
"\tdepending on their connection service. Also\n"
"\tconsider your server and network load.\n"
"\t</p><p>\n"
"\tThe flash player does not have similar attributes,\n"
"\tbut will behave similarly with regard to an\n"
"\tinitial image: if one was not set, and the\n"
"\tpreload option is not \"none,\" then the player\n"
"\twill start playback and let it advance for a\n"
"\tsmall random period, and then pause playback,\n"
"\tleaving a visible frame to act as a 'poster.'\n"

"\t\"Select flash video URL from uploads directory\" and\n"
"\t\"Select ID for flash video from media library.\"\n"
"\tThe first of these two holds a selection of files\n"
"\tfound under your <code>wp-content/uploads</code>\n"
"\tdirectory with a FLV or MP4 extension. Files\n"
"\tare placed under this directory when you use the\n"
"\t<em>WordPress</em> media library, but you may also\n"
"\tplace files there 'by hand' using, for example,\n"
"\tftp or ssh or any suitable utility (placing files\n"
"\tin a subdirectory is a good idea).\n"
"\tIn fact, uploading video files 'by hand' might\n"
"\tbe the easiest way to bypass size limits that\n"
"\treject large video file uploads through the\n"
"\tmedia library interface. The next field\n"
"\thas a selection of media files with a\n"
"\t<em>WordPress</em> 'attachment id' and so it\n"
"\tprovides only those files uploaded to the media\n"
"\tlibrary (with a FLV or MP4 extension).\n"
"\t</p><p>\n"
"\tAfter those three fields for flash video, there is\n"
"\t\"HTML5 video URLs or media library IDs\" which,\n"
"\tlike the flash text entry, is followed by selections\n"
"\tof files and 'attachment id's. These show files\n"
"\twith MP4 or OGG or OGV or WEBM extensions. As the\n"
"\tfield names suggest, these are for the HTML5 video\n"
"\tplayer. An important difference is that when you\n"
"\tmake a selection, the entry field is appended,\n"
"\trather than replaced, with a '|' separator.\n"
"\tThe HTML5 video entry field can take more than one\n"
"\tvalue, as explained below.\n"
"\t</p><p>\n"
"\tIt is not necessary to fill both the flash and HTML5\n"
"\tvideo URL fields, but it is a good idea to do so\n"
"\tif you can prepare the video in the needed formats.\n"
"\t</p><p>\n"
"\tBy default, HTML5 is made primary content with\n"
"\tflash as fallback. You may make flash be primary\n"
"\tand HTML5 be fallback with the \"HTML5 video primary\"\n"
"\toption on the settings page. (Go to the \"Settings\"\n"
"\tmenu and select \"SWFPut Plugin\" for the settings page.)\n"
"\t</p><p>\n"
"\tThe current state of affairs with HTML5 video will\n"
"\trequire three transcodings of the video if you\n"
"\twant broad browser support; moreover, the supported\n"
"\t\"container\" formats -- .webm, .ogg/.ogv, and .mp4 --\n"
"\tmight contain different audio and video types (\"codecs\")\n"
"\tand only some of these will be supported by various\n"
"\tbrowsers.\n"
"\tUsers not already familiar with this topic should\n"
"\tdo enough research to make the preceding statements\n"
"\tclear.\n"
"\t</p><p>\n"
"\tThe \"HTML5 video URLs\" field\n"
"\twill accept any number of URLs, which\n"
"\tmust be separated by '|'. Each URL <em>may</em>\n"
"\tbe appended with a mime-type + codecs argument,\n"
"\tseparated from the URL by '?'. Whitespace around\n"
"\tthe separators is accepted and stripped-off. Please\n"
"\tnote that the argument given should <em>not</em>\n"
"\tinclude \"type=\" or quotes: give only the\n"
"\tstatement that should appear within the quotes.\n"
"\tFor example:</p>\n"
"\t<blockquote><code>\n"
"\tvids/gato.mp4 ? video/mp4 | vids/gato.webm ? video/webm; codecs=vp8,"
"vorbis | vids/gato.ogv?video/ogg; codecs=theora,vorbis\n"
"\t</code></blockquote>\n"
"\t<p>\n"
"\tIn the example, where two codecs are specified there is\n"
"\tno space after the comma.\n"
"\tSome online examples, and even HTML specifaction pages,\n"
"\tshow a space after the comma,\n"
"\tbut browsers might reject that\n"
"\tusage, so SWFPut will normalize the codecs argument.\n"
"\t</p><p>\n"
"\t<h4>Use initial image as no-video alternate</h4>\n"
"\tThis checkbox, if enabled (it is, by default) will\n"
"\tuse the \"initial image file\" that may be specified\n"
"\tfor the video player in an 'img' element\n"
"\tthat the visitor's browser might display if video\n"
"\tis not available.\n"
"\t</p><p>\n"
"\tThere is one additional consideration for this image:\n"
"\tthe 'img' element is given the width and height\n"
"\tspecified in the form for the flash player, and the\n"
"\tvisitor's browser will scale the image in both\n"
"\tdimensions, possibly causing the image to be\n"
"\t'stretched' or 'squeezed'.\n"
"\tThe image proportions are restored with\n"
"\t<em>JavaScript</em>, but only if scripts are\n"
"\tnot disabled in the visitor's browser.\n"
"\tTherefore, it is a\n"
"\tgood idea to prepare images to have the expected\n"
"\t<em>pixel</em> aspect ratio\n"
"\t(top/bottom or left/right tranparent\n"
"\tareas might be one solution).\n"
"\t</p><p>\n"
"\t<h4>Mobile width</h4>\n"
"\tThis input field appears just below the\n"
"\tpixel dimensions fields. If this value is\n"
"\tgreater than zero, and a mobile browser is\n"
"\tdetected, then this width will be used with\n"
"\ta proportional height according to the\n"
"\tregular pixel dimensions. This might be\n"
"\tuseful when, for example, sidebar content\n"
"\tactually appears below main content due to\n"
"\tthe mobile browser's small size (theme support\n"
"\tmay be necessary to see this behavior). This\n"
"\tis probably most useful for video widgets placed\n"
"\ton a sidebar, but please experiment.\n"
"\tThe default value for this field, 0,\n"
"\tdisables this feature, and it has no effect if\n"
"\ta mobile browser is not detected.\n"
"\t</p><p>\n"
"\t<h4>Video preload</h4>\n"
"\tThis \"radio\" type option is in the <b>Behavior</b> section\n"
"\tof the form. HTML5 video allows a \"preload\" attribute\n"
"\twith a value of \"none\" or \"metadata\" or \"auto.\" This\n"
"\toption provides those three values and one special selection:\n"
"\t\"per initial image.\" This special selection will use\n"
"\t\"none\" if an \"initial image file\" is set (in the <b>Media</b>\n"
"\tsection of the form), or \"metadata\" if an initial\n"
"\timage, or <i>poster</i>, is not set.\n"
"\t</p><p>\n"
"\tThe \"metadata\" selection tells the browser that it\n"
"\tmay fetch a small part of the video file that\n"
"\tincludes information such as dimensions, duration,\n"
"\tcodec types.\n"
"\tThis can be useful because with\n"
"\tit a browser might also receive some of the video\n"
"\tframes, and so it may display one frame as a 'poster.'\n"
"\t(Whether a\n"
"\tframe displayed this way is suitable is not certain.)\n"
"\t</p><p>\n"
"\tIf \"none\" is selected the browser will not fetch\n"
"\tany of the video until it is played, and so without\n"
"\tan initial image, the video region on the page will\n"
"\tbe solid black until played.\n"
"\t</p><p>\n"
"\tThe \"auto\" selection should be avoided unless you\n"
"\tknow what it does and that you need it. This is\n"
"\tbecause with \"auto\" the browser may choose to\n"
"\tfetch the entire video even before the visitor\n"
"\tactively plays the video. Video files can be\n"
"\tquite large, and a large unsolicited download\n"
"\tmight be unkind to your site's visitors; it\n"
"\tmight even cause a visitor additional charges\n"
"\tdepending on their connection service. Also\n"
"\tconsider your server and network load.\n"
"\t</p><p>\n"
"\tThe flash player does not have similar attributes,\n"
"\tbut will behave similarly with regard to an\n"
"\tinitial image: if one was not set, and the\n"
"\tpreload option is not \"none,\" then the player\n"
"\twill start playback and let it advance for a\n"
"\tsmall random period, and then pause playback,\n"
"\tleaving a visible frame to act as a 'poster.'\n"
