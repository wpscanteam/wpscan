- All data being read from any of these PHP global variables $_POST / $_GET / $_REQUEST / $_COOKIE / $_SERVER / $_SESSION / $_FILES has been sanitized before storing it in another variable or doing something else with it.

In this code, the following sanitization functions have been used:

sanitize_text_field() for text fields.
absint() for integers.
esc_url_raw() for raw URLs.
These sanitization functions ensure that the input data is safe to use and minimize the risk of security vulnerabilities.

- Appropriate escaping functions (esc_html, esc_url_raw, sanitize_text_field) added to the variables that are being echoed or printed to ensure that the output is safe from XSS vulnerabilities.
