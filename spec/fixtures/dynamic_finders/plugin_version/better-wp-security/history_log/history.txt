6.3.0 - 2017-07-06 - Chris Jean & Timothy Jacobs
	Important: The way that Hide Backend functions changes in this release. Previously, if your Hide Backend Login Slug was wplogin, going to example.com/wplogin would result in the URL remaining example.com/wplogin. The new implementation of this feature results in a redirect to a URL that looks as follows: example.com/wp-login.php?itsec-hb-token=wplogin. While this may not be desireable for some users, this change was necessary to fix longstanding compatibility issues with other plugins. Once you access the login page using the Login Slug page, a cookie is set with an expiration time of one hour. As long as the cookie remains, you can access example.com/wp-login.php without having to access the Hide Backend Login Slug first. If you wish to confirm that Hide Backend is working properly on your site, opening up a private browsing window is a quick way to test without having to log out and clear cookies.

	Enhancement: Hide Backend functions purely in PHP code now rather than relying half on PHP code and half on .htaccess and nginx.conf modifications. This allows Hide Backend to function on web servers and server configurations that it was previously not compatible with.
	Misc: Updated or added phpDoc to many functions.
	Misc: Updated Disable File Locking description.
6.4.0 - 2017-07-24 - Chris Jean & Timothy Jacobs
