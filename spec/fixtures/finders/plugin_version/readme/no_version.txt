Simple Login Lockdown prevents brute force login attacks/attempts on your WordPress installation.

== Description ==

Simple login lock down is a way to protect your WordPress blog from brute force login attacks.

How it works:
1. An attacker attempts to login and fails
2. Simple Login Lockdown record that failed login
3. After a certain number of failed attemps (defaults to five), further attemps to access the wp-login.php page are blocked for a time (defaults to one hour).

If you happen to forget your password and make a failed login attemp yourself, the plugin will clear out the lockdown count data on successful login.

Note: This uses $_SERVER['REMOTE_ADDR'] directly.  If you're behind a proxy (load balancer, etc), it's not going to work as expected.  Eg. Several folks could be attempting logins at once, and all fail.  As such, the plugin would pick up on all those requests coming from the same IP -- the load balancer -- and lock the login down.  No good.  If you're using a load balancer or in some other situation where you're behind a proxy, use this as an example and write your own. Or filter the IP as your desire using `cd_sll_pre_ip`.

== Installation ==

1. Click on the big orange button that says download
2. Unzip the file, and upload the `simple-login-lockdown` folder to your wp-content/plugins directory

= I got locked out, what do I do? =

Simple answer: wait.  The lockdown will clear in the time you specified, just visit the site again later.

If you absolutely need to get into your site right now, you can can do one of two things...
1. Fire up your FTP client and rename the `simple-login-lockdown` plugin folder
2. Login into your favorite database administration tool (probably PHPMyAdmin) and search for `locked_down_` in the `option_name` column of the `wp_options` table.  Delete the records you find -- they should be "transients".
