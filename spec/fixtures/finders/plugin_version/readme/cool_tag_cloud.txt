A simple, yet very beautiful tag cloud.

== Description ==

The plugin renders a tag cloud using a professionally designed tag image as a background.

The plugin's tag cloud is completely responsive and is correctly rendered in all browsers.

The main usage is with the "Cool Tag Cloud" widget but you can also use the shortcode [cool_tag_cloud].

Here's the list of all available parameters for the shortcode:

- style="default|silver|green|red|blue|brown|purple|cyan|lime|black"
- font_family="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"
- smallest="10"
- largest="10"
- align="left|right"
- font_weight="normal|bold"
- text_transform="none|uppercase|lowercase|capitalize"
- number="20"
- order_by="name|count"
- order="ASC|DESC|RAND"
- taxonomy="post_tag"
- nofollow="yes|no"
- animation="yes|no"
- on_single_display="global|local"
- exclude="1,2,3"
- include="1,2,3"

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Why is the font size limited to 17px? =

Because when a larger font size is set, the tag text does not fit into the tag image.

Yes, please use [translate.wordpress.org](https://translate.wordpress.org/projects/wp-plugins/cool-tag-cloud).
