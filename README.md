# INSTALL

## Prerequisites

- (Optional but highly recommended: [RVM](https://rvm.io/rvm/install))
- Ruby >= 3.0 - Recommended: latest
- Curl >= 7.72  - Recommended: latest
  - The 7.29 has a segfault
  - The < 7.72 could result in `Stream error in the HTTP/2 framing layer` in some cases
- RubyGems      - Recommended: latest
- Nokogiri might require packages to be installed via your package manager depending on your OS, see https://nokogiri.org/tutorials/installing_nokogiri.html

### In a Pentesting distribution

When using a pentesting distribution (such as Kali Linux), it is recommended to install/update wpscan via the package manager if available.

### In macOSX via Homebrew

```shell
brew install wpscanteam/tap/wpscan
```

### From RubyGems

```shell
gem install wpscan
```

On MacOSX, if a ```Gem::FilePermissionError``` is raised due to the Apple's System Integrity Protection (SIP), either install RVM and install wpscan again, or run ```sudo gem install -n /usr/local/bin wpscan``` (see [#1286](https://github.com/wpscanteam/wpscan/issues/1286))

# Updating

You can update the local database by using ```wpscan --update```

Updating WPScan itself is either done via ```gem update wpscan``` or the packages manager (this is quite important for distributions such as in Kali Linux: ```apt-get update && apt-get upgrade```) depending on how WPScan was (pre)installed

# Docker

Pull the repo with ```docker pull wpscanteam/wpscan```

Enumerating usernames

```shell
docker run -it --rm wpscanteam/wpscan --url https://target.tld/ --enumerate u
```

Enumerating a range of usernames

```shell
docker run -it --rm wpscanteam/wpscan --url https://target.tld/ --enumerate u1-100
```

** replace u1-100 with a range of your choice.

# Usage

Full user documentation can be found here; https://github.com/wpscanteam/wpscan/wiki/WPScan-User-Documentation

```wpscan --url blog.tld``` This will scan the blog using default options with a good compromise between speed and accuracy. For example, the plugins will be checked passively but their version with a mixed detection mode (passively + aggressively). Potential config backup files will also be checked, along with other interesting findings.

If a more stealthy approach is required, then ```wpscan --stealthy --url blog.tld``` can be used.
As a result, when using the ```--enumerate``` option, don't forget to set the ```--plugins-detection``` accordingly, as its default is 'passive'.

For more options, open a terminal and type ```wpscan --help``` (if you built wpscan from the source, you should type the command outside of the git repo)

The DB is located at ~/.wpscan/db

## Optional: WordPress Vulnerability Database API

The WPScan CLI tool uses the [WordPress Vulnerability Database API](https://wpscan.com/api) to retrieve WordPress vulnerability data in real time. For WPScan to retrieve the vulnerability data an API token must be supplied via the `--api-token` option, or via a configuration file, as discussed below. An API token can be obtained by registering an account on [WPScan.com](https://wpscan.com/register).

Up to **25** API requests per day are given free of charge, that should be suitable to scan most WordPress websites at least once per day. When the daily 25 API requests are exhausted, WPScan will continue to work as normal but without any vulnerability data.

### How many API requests do you need?

- Our WordPress scanner makes one API request for the WordPress version, one request per installed plugin and one request per installed theme.
- On average, a WordPress website has 22 installed plugins.

## Load CLI options from file/s

WPScan can load all options (including the --url) from configuration files, the following locations are checked (order: first to last):

- ~/.wpscan/scan.json
- ~/.wpscan/scan.yml
- pwd/.wpscan/scan.json
- pwd/.wpscan/scan.yml

If those files exist, options from the `cli_options` key will be loaded and overridden if found twice.

e.g:

~/.wpscan/scan.yml:

```yml
cli_options:
  proxy: 'http://127.0.0.1:8080'
  verbose: true
```

pwd/.wpscan/scan.yml:

```yml
cli_options:
  proxy: 'socks5://127.0.0.1:9090'
  url: 'http://target.tld'
```

Running ```wpscan``` in the current directory (pwd), is the same as ```wpscan -v --proxy socks5://127.0.0.1:9090 --url http://target.tld```

## Save API Token in a file

The feature mentioned above is useful to keep the API Token in a config file and not have to supply it via the CLI each time. To do so, create the ~/.wpscan/scan.yml file containing the below:

```yml
cli_options:
  api_token: 'YOUR_API_TOKEN'
```

## Load API Token From ENV (since v3.7.10)

The API Token will be automatically loaded from the ENV variable `WPSCAN_API_TOKEN` if present. If the `--api-token` CLI option is also provided, the value from the CLI will be used.


## Enumerating usernames

```shell
wpscan --url https://target.tld/ --enumerate u
```

Enumerating a range of usernames

```shell
wpscan --url https://target.tld/ --enumerate u1-100
```

** replace u1-100 with a range of your choice.
